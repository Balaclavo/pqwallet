**Disclaimer**

This is a functional prototype I built through "vibe coding" with the help of an AI assistant. The goal was to explore Rust and experience the power of its ecosystem. It genuinely feels like using a package manager similar to `apt`, which makes working with dependencies a breeze.

This prototype generates keys offline, encrypts them with a password, and stores them in a JSON file. You can later decrypt and read them when needed.

**Final Thoughts**

Coding in Rust with the assistance of AI is a great way to learn. Rust’s compiler provides detailed and self-explanatory error messages, and when combined with the occasional mistakes from AI-generated code, the debugging process becomes a powerful learning experience.

In my opinion, strong debugging skills are more important than pure coding ability. For prototyping, the combination of AI and Rust has been the most effective approach I’ve tried so far.

Rust's idiomatic and strongly typed nature makes the generated code easier to read and understand. While you'll need to refactor redundant sections, isolate logic, and clean up the structure, the clarity of a Rust prototype makes it an excellent foundation for building a production-ready version.
