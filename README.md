# 🛡️ pqwallet – Post-Quantum Wallet Generator (Dilithium5)

Welcome to **pqwallet**, a lightweight, offline-first wallet generator built in **Rust** 🦀 using **Dilithium5**, a cutting-edge post-quantum cryptographic algorithm.

This project marks my first venture into the world of Rust and serves as a foundational component for a larger initiative currently in development.

---

⚠️ **Disclaimer**

Please note: This is an **experimental project** and my inaugural app written in Rust. While it's fully functional, it's important to understand its nature as a learning exercise and building block.

💡 **What pqwallet Generates**

**pqwallet** is a simple yet powerful tool that generates:

*   🔑 A **Post-Quantum Safe Private Key**
*   🔓 A Corresponding **Public Key**
*   🏷️ A Human-Friendly **Wallet Address** (e.g., `PQx0847474747447...`)

The wallet address acts as a unique, user-friendly identity identifier, specifically designed to replace the unwieldy public key in practical applications. It enables **secure, pseudonymous identity handling** in a post-quantum world.

🚀 **Why Post-Quantum?**

Current cryptographic standards are inherently vulnerable to the looming threat of **quantum computing**. **pqwallet** leverages **Dilithium5**, a **NIST-approved** post-quantum digital signature algorithm, to ensure that:

*   Your identity remains **secure**, even in the age of quantum computers.
*   Your **private key cannot be reverse-engineered** from the public key—even with theoretical quantum computing capabilities.

---

📝 **Use Cases**

The generated private key can be used to **sign messages and documents offline**, offering:

*   A lightweight **proof of authenticity** system.
*   A secure way to **verify authorship** for digital art, legal documents, identity claims, and more.
*   Full **anonymity** and **consent-based disclosure**, since identity is not inherently tied to the public key.

Even in the event of a quantum breakthrough, your data and identity remain **protected**.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

*   **Language:** Rust 🦀
*   **Crypto:** CRYSTALS-Dilithium5 (Post-Quantum Digital Signatures)
*   **Security Model:** Offline-first, quantum-resilient

---

🔜 **Coming Soon**

This tool is an integral part of a broader project I'm building. Stay tuned for:

*   Integration into a **full identity/authentication framework**
*   User interface for **key management**
*   Extended features like **multi-signature wallets** and **encrypted key storage**
